# Third Party Notices

## opencode-free-proxy

OpenCodeProxyHub is derived from and substantially inspired by `opencode-free-proxy`.

Source:

```text

```

The original project declares the MIT License in its `package.json` and `README.md`.

Original package metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "opencode-free-proxy",
  "version": "0.9.0",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

The original project provides the core idea and compatibility behavior for exposing OpenCode free models through OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible API endpoints.

OpenCodeProxyHub has been substantially rewritten and expanded, but keeps this attribution to preserve the original MIT notice and project credit.

## Runtime And Build Dependencies

OpenCodeProxyHub uses Node.js, TypeScript, Fastify, the `redis` client,
`https-proxy-agent`, `socks-proxy-agent`, `socks`, `dotenv`, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS,
daisyUI, and their related transitive dependencies.

The dependency license review performed during development found the dependency
set to be composed of permissive licenses compatible with MIT distribution,
including:

- MIT
- ISC
- BSD-2-Clause / BSD-3-Clause
- Apache-2.0
- BlueOak-1.0.0 — used by several `isaacs` packages pulled in transitively
  (e.g. `glob`, `lru-cache`, `minimatch`, `minipass`, `jackspeak`,
  `path-scurry`). BlueOak-1.0.0 is an OSI-approved permissive license.
- CC-BY-4.0 — applies only to `caniuse-lite`, a build-time browser-compatibility
  data set pulled in by `browserslist` / `autoprefixer`. It is not included in
  the runtime output and only requires attribution.

No GPL, AGPL, or LGPL dependency was identified in the application dependency set
during this review.

If you redistribute a built Docker image, also review and preserve notices for the base image and operating system packages included by `node:20-alpine`.

## Service And Trademark Notice

OpenCodeProxyHub is not affiliated with OpenCode or any upstream service provider.

This project's open source license does not grant rights to use third-party services, APIs, trademarks, or infrastructure beyond their own terms.
